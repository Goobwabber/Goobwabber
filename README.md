### Hey!

I'm a full-stack dev and have a large variety of experience. Most of my projects are based around mods for Beat Saber, a popular VR rhythm game.

### Overview:

- Main contributor for [MultiplayerExtensions](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerExtensions), the core multiplayer mod for Beatsaber.
- I also manage a few more BeatSaber mods: 
  - [MultiplayerAvatars](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerAvatars), a mod that allows other players to see your custom VR avatars in multiplayer.
  - [BeatSaberOptimizer](https://github.com/Goobwabber/BeatsaberOptimizer), which optimizes some of the base game code to make it more performant.
  
I do a lot of work on smaller private projects behind the scenes as well.
