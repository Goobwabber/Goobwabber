### Hey!

I'm a full-stack dev and have a large variety of experience. Most of my projects are based around mods for Beat Saber, a popular VR rhythm game. I have a passion for and enjoy networking and backend development the most of anything I write.

### Overview:

- Main contributor for [MultiplayerCore](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerCore), [MultiplayerExtensions](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerExtensions), and [BeatTogether](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether) the core multiplayer mods for Beatsaber.
- I also manage a few more BeatSaber mods: 
  - [MultiQuestensions](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiQuestensions), the Quest port of MultiplayerExtensions.
  - [BeatSaberOptimizer](https://github.com/Goobwabber/BeatsaberOptimizer), which optimizes some of the base game code to make it more performant.
  - [PauseCoob](https://github.com/Goobwabber/PauseCoob), which adds a coob that pauses the game when cut.
  - [MultiplayerAvatars](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerAvatars), a mod that allows other players to see your custom VR avatars in multiplayer.
  
- Here are some of the BeatTogether repos, in case you were looking for them:
  - [BeatTogether.Core](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether.Core) 
  - [BeatTogether.MasterServer](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether.MasterServer) 
  - [BeatTogether.DedicatedServer](https://github.com/pythonology/BeatTogether.DedicatedServer) 
  - [BeatTogether.LiteNetLib](https://github.com/goobwabber/BeatTogether.LiteNetLib)
  
I do a lot of work on smaller private projects behind the scenes as well.
